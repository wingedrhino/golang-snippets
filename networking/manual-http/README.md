# Manual HTTP

Implementing HTTP methods using socket programming alone.

HTTP in versions 1.0 and 1.1 is simply text encoded as bytes sent to a socket
to make requests and the response likewise is text encoded as bytes.

Read [IETF's RFC1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945) for details on the
syntax of the various HTTP methods.

[HTTP on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
has some examples you can copy-paste.
