# Elastic Mapper - Generate ElasticSearch Type Mapping

I'm using Reflection to try and auto-generate ElasticSearch mapping JSON.

I don't currently check or respect the `json` tags to see if the name rendered
is the same as what would be if the object is serialized so don't use this in
production! It works for a very specific use-case with lots of autogenerated
code I'm dealing with.

I've also hard-coded a check for `time.Time` and I'm sure there's a better way
of doing this.

Hopefully this snippet outgrows this repository and becomes a tool by itself.

[github.com/Jeffail/gabs](https://github.com/Jeffail/gabs) made it really easy
to generate a complex JSON tree.

## Text vs Keyword fields

Use `elasticmapper:"text"` to specify that a string field is text. Otherwise I
assume it is a keyword. I should make this bit configurable as a flag to decide
what the default is.

## Nested Objects

Logically, you want an array of structs to be a nested object. Nested structs
are just simple objects that ElasticSearch can flatten.
